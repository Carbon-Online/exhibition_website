# Exhibition Website
This repo contains a static html website. This website will be available through a local network at the exhibition and
hosted on a RaspberryPi 3.
# Aim
Users will be able to generate datatraffic by using this website. This traffic will be tracked by the `artifact software`.
Its theoretical carbon footprint if it were a real WWW application will be visualized by the artifact. This way the
visitors will have a sense of how our artifact will work and behave in a real scenario.
